Introduction
============

c4h_timers is a package of python modules and hardware instructions for creating and operating timing gates fro equestrian and similar events. The code is written in `<CircuitPython https://circuitpython.org/>`_ and built around the `Adafruit Feather family of microprocessors <https://www.adafruit.com/feather>`_.

Motivation
**********

Timing equipment for equestrian events is expensive and beyond the financial means of many small clubs. The aim is to provide the ability for less financial clubs to obtain good quality timing equipment at a reasonable price (and a little effort).
